### The stop button problem

A very interesting problem based on how to deal with having a manual stop button on a superintelligent agent that might learn to fight you and stop you from hitting the stop button. Trying to align our interests exactly with the agent's interests is a pretty complex problem and this might be too complex for us to solve right now but it's worth exploring a bit. Here are some interesting resources regarding this problem:
