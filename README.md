This project is completed and submitted as a part of CS7IS2 Module Coursework assignment.
It consist of implementation and analysis of various algorithms implemented for solving 2048 game problem.

##Setting up the environment 2048

* Install python3-tk package for GUI
```
 sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

* change directory
```
cd 2048/
```

* In order to run all the test cases which demonstrates the implementation of algorithms
written for solving 2048, simply run the following command from terminal.
```
python3 -m unittest discover ./ 

```

All the evaluations and generated scores are listed in evaluation folder in csv format.
The comparative analysis of implemented algorithms is done and graphs are plotted for better understanding.
